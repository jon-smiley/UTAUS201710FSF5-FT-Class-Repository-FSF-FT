## Intro to JavaScript / Intro to jQuery

### Overview

In this week we will be introducing students to their first taste of JavaScript. They will then use their newfound understanding of variables, arrays, loops, and conditionals to create a simple Hangman or Psychic Guessing Game.

Then will be introducing students to jQuery. Students will understand the basic concepts of DOM manipulation, on-click events, and basic GUI building. By the end of the week they will deepen their understanding of JavaScript scope.
